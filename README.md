# ambient_light

Ambient light I programmed with Arduino and RGB LEDs.
Controlled with IR remote (considering upgrade to BT or Wi-Fi).

Components:
- Adafruit Trinket Pro 5V/16MHz
- 8-light addressable addressable RGB LED strip (WS2812 / "neopixels")
- IR receiver
- 5V/1A power supply + barrel adapter
